# blog-template

A template for a blog, using Vue 3, Tailwind, Hypgraph and Firebase. The app is setup generically can be easily utilized and edited for different use cases. 

Reasons for choosing these techniques:

1. Vue 3: easy to learn lightweight front-end framework, with great support and documentation.
2. Tailwind: a utility-first css framework which greatly reduces the amount of css you have to write and maintain.
3. Hygraph: CMS which is amazing for smaller projects as it is free to use and has a simple and clean interface.
4. Firebase: the place where we host our project, and as with Hypgraph, the lower-tier is free.
